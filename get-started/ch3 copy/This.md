## `this` Keyword

One of JS's most powerful mechanisms is also one of its most misunderstood: the `this` keyword. One common misconception is that a function's `this` refers to the function itself. Because of how `this` works in other languages, another misconception is that `this` points the instance that a method belongs to. Both are incorrect.

As discussed previously, when a function is defined, it is *attached* to its enclosing scope via closure. Scope is the set of rules that controls how references to variables are resolved.

But functions also have another characteristic besides their scope that influences what they can access. This characteristic is best described as an *execution context*, and it's exposed to the function via its `this` keyword.

Scope is static and contains a fixed set of variables available at the moment and location you define a function, but a function's execution *context* is dynamic, entirely dependent on **how it is called** (regardless of where it is defined or even called from).

`this` is not a fixed characteristic of a function based on the function's definition, but rather a dynamic characteristic that's determined each time the function is called.

One way to think about the *execution context* is that it's a tangible object whose properties are made available to a function while it executes. Compare that to scope, which can also be thought of as an *object*; except, the *scope object* is hidden inside the JS engine, it's always the same for that function, and its *properties* take the form of identifier variables available inside the function.

```js
function classroom(teacher) {
    return function study() {
        console.log(
            `${ teacher } says to study ${ this.topic }`
        );
    };
}
var assignment = classroom("Kyle");
```

The outer `classroom(..)` function makes no reference to a `this` keyword, so it's just like any other function we've seen so far. But the inner `study()` function does reference `this`, which makes it a `this`-aware function. In other words, it's a function that is dependent on its *execution context*.

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| `study()` is also closed over the `teacher` variable from its outer scope. |

The inner `study()` function returned by `classroom("Kyle")` is assigned to a variable called `assignment`. So how can `assignment()` (aka `study()`) be called?

```js
assignment();
// Kyle says to study undefined  -- Oops :(
```

In this snippet, we call `assignment()` as a plain, normal function, without providing it any *execution context*.

Since this program is not in strict mode (see Chapter 1, "Strictly Speaking"), context-aware functions that are called **without any context specified** default the context to the global object (`window` in the browser). As there is no global variable named `topic` (and thus no such property on the global object), `this.topic` resolves to `undefined`.

Now consider:

```js
var homework = {
    topic: "JS",
    assignment: assignment
};

homework.assignment();
// Kyle says to study JS
```

A copy of the `assignment` function reference is set as a property on the `homework` object, and then it's called as `homework.assignment()`. That means the `this` for that function call will be the `homework` object. Hence, `this.topic` resolves to `"JS"`.

Lastly:

```js
var otherHomework = {
    topic: "Math"
};

assignment.call(otherHomework);
// Kyle says to study Math
```

A third way to invoke a function is with the `call(..)` method, which takes an object (`otherHomework` here) to use for setting the `this` reference for the function call. The property reference `this.topic` resolves to `"Math"`.

The same context-aware function invoked three different ways, gives different answers each time for what object `this` will reference.

The benefit of `this`-aware functions—and their dynamic context—is the ability to more flexibly re-use a single function with data from different objects. A function that closes over a scope can never reference a different scope or set of variables. But a function that has dynamic `this` context awareness can be quite helpful for certain tasks.
