## Prototypes

Where `this` is a characteristic of function execution, a prototype is a characteristic of an object, and specifically resolution of a property access.

Think about a prototype as a linkage between two objects; the linkage is hidden behind the scenes, though there are ways to expose and observe it. This prototype linkage occurs when an object is created; it's linked to another object that already exists.

A series of objects linked together via prototypes is called the "prototype chain."

The purpose of this prototype linkage (i.e., from an object B to another object A) is so that accesses against B for properties/methods that B does not have, are *delegated* to A to handle. Delegation of property/method access allows two (or more!) objects to cooperate with each other to perform a task.

Consider defining an object as a normal literal:

```js
var homework = {
    topic: "JS"
};
```

The `homework` object only has a single property on it: `topic`. However, its default prototype linkage connects to the `Object.prototype` object, which has common built-in methods on it like `toString()` and `valueOf()`, among others.

We can observe this prototype linkage *delegation* from `homework` to `Object.prototype`:

```js
homework.toString();    // [object Object]
```

`homework.toString()` works even though `homework` doesn't have a `toString()` method defined; the delegation invokes `Object.prototype.toString()` instead.

### Object Linkage

To define an object prototype linkage, you can create the object using the `Object.create(..)` utility:

```js
var homework = {
    topic: "JS"
};

var otherHomework = Object.create(homework);

otherHomework.topic;   // "JS"
```

The first argument to `Object.create(..)` specifies an object to link the newly created object to, and then returns the newly created (and linked!) object.

Figure 4 shows how the three objects (`otherHomework`, `homework`, and `Object.prototype`) are linked in a prototype chain:

    <br><br>
</figure>

Delegation through the prototype chain only applies for accesses to lookup the value in a property. If you assign to a property of an object, that will apply directly to the object regardless of where that object is prototype linked to.

| TIP: |
| :--- |
| `Object.create(null)` creates an object that is not prototype linked anywhere, so it's purely just a standalone object; in some circumstances, that may be preferable. |

Consider:

```js
homework.topic;
// "JS"

otherHomework.topic;
// "JS"

otherHomework.topic = "Math";
otherHomework.topic;
// "Math"

homework.topic;
// "JS" -- not "Math"
```

The assignment to `topic` creates a property of that name directly on `otherHomework`; there's no effect on the `topic` property on `homework`. The next statement then accesses `otherHomework.topic`, and we see the non-delegated answer from that new property: `"Math"`.

Figure 5 shows the objects/properties after the assignment that creates the `otherHomework.topic` property:

<figure>
    <img src="images/fig5.png" width="200" alt="3 objects linked, with shadowed property" align="center">
    <figcaption><em>Fig. 5: Shadowed property 'topic'</em></figcaption>
    <br><br>
</figure>

The `topic` on `otherHomework` is "shadowing" the property of the same name on the `homework` object in the chain.

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| Another frankly more convoluted but perhaps still more common way of creating an object with a prototype linkage is using the "prototypal class" pattern, from before `class` (see Chapter 2, "Classes") was added in ES6. We'll cover this topic in more detail in Appendix A, "Prototypal 'Classes'". |

### `this` Revisited

We covered the `this` keyword earlier, but its true importance shines when considering how it powers prototype-delegated function calls. Indeed, one of the main reasons `this` supports dynamic context based on how the function is called is so that method calls on objects which delegate through the prototype chain still maintain the expected `this`.

Consider:

```js
var homework = {
    study() {
        console.log(`Please study ${ this.topic }`);
    }
};

var jsHomework = Object.create(homework);
jsHomework.topic = "JS";
jsHomework.study();
// Please study JS

var mathHomework = Object.create(homework);
mathHomework.topic = "Math";
mathHomework.study();
// Please study Math
```

The two objects `jsHomework` and `mathHomework` each prototype link to the single `homework` object, which has the `study()` function. `jsHomework` and `mathHomework` are each given their own `topic` property (see Figure 6).

<figure>
    <img src="images/fig6.png" width="495" alt="4 objects prototype linked" align="center">
    <figcaption><em>Fig. 6: Two objects linked to a common parent</em></figcaption>
    <br><br>
</figure>

`jsHomework.study()` delegates to `homework.study()`, but its `this` (`this.topic`) for that execution resolves to `jsHomework` because of how the function is called, so `this.topic` is `"JS"`. Similarly for `mathHomework.study()` delegating to `homework.study()` but still resolving `this` to `mathHomework`, and thus `this.topic` as `"Math"`.

The preceding code snippet would be far less useful if `this` was resolved to `homework`. Yet, in many other languages, it would seem `this` would be `homework` because the `study()` method is indeed defined on `homework`.

Unlike many other languages, JS's `this` being dynamic is a critical component of allowing prototype delegation, and indeed `class`, to work as expected!
