# I Know JS: Get Started - 1st Edition

# Foreword

In my mindset of what I know about js I came across a couple of very interesting books that made me wonder how far I can go with JS.

And then we start writing, reviewing information and marveling at how easily we can share knowledge with other people.

This is how the desire and desire to write this book or this series of books arose.

the juice never ends and we just started.

surely when it is discontinued some parts of the information count may be irrelevant.

the trick is to inform the surroundings and not depend on a single information,

enjoy the ride and share it.

Some words from Brian Holt - Senior Program Manager


Kyle:

"Once I dug in and poured over the texts,

I experienced a profound mix of learning""

<br/>

this book series is great for people how are picking up the language.
it's for all software craftspeople who want to master their tools, 
who want to understand the ins and outs of their trade, 
and who want to select the proper methods for solving problems.

The thing I appreciate about Kyle and his work is that
he is delightfully uninfluenced by the zeitgeist of the programming world around him.
